            A foot ulcer is an open wound or sore that can develop on the feet. These ulcers are commonly found on the bottom or top of the feet and can often be caused by various health conditions, including diabetes, poor circulation, or nerve damage.
        </p>
        <p>
            People with diabetes are at higher risk due to nerve damage (neuropathy) that decreases sensitivity in the feet. Without feeling pain or discomfort, a person might not notice a wound or ulcer developing, allowing it to worsen. Poor circulation can also hinder healing, which can lead to infection and, in severe cases, require amputation if not addressed early.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's essential to monitor your feet regularly for any signs of damage, such as blisters, cuts, or sores. Early detection can help prevent severe complications.
